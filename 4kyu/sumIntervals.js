 Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once. 
 Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array.
  The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. 
  Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.
